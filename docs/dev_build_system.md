# Use the build system

We use [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) as main build system for the project.

## Get the build system

To build the project you forst need a PlatformIO installation.
There are several ways to get to this point:
* You can install their [VS Code IDE](http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/ide/vscode.html#ide-vscode) or [Atom IDE](http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/ide/atom.html#ide-atom).
* You can install the [Core version](http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core.html).

In terms of building the project, both variants are equal.


## First build

After the installation you go into the project directory and call:
```bash
$ platformio run
```

This build the project and creats a firmware that you can upload to the controller.
