# Blinkenhat

## Introduction

The blinkenhat is a little project to enable interrested people with little or less experience in electronics or programming into this field.
It was founded to hold a workshop where people can build a blinking hat.
The main parts are:
1. A little PCB with a microcontroller
2. The Software running on the microcontroller
3. A control-UI where the user can change the behaviour of the device.

The whole project is open source and completely available on [Github](https://github.com/Retardigrades/blinkenhat).
