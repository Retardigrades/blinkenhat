## Introduction

The blinkenhat is a little project to enable interrested people with little or less experience in electronics or programming into this field.
It was founded to hold a workshop where people can build a blinking hat.
The main parts are:
1. A little PCB with a microcontroller
2. The Software running on the microcontroller
3. A control-UI where the user can change the behaviour of the device.

The whole project is open source and completely available on [Github](https://github.com/Retardigrades/blinkenhat).

## User documentation

There are several parts of the usage to describe:
1. [User Interface](usage_user_interface)

## Project documentation

In this section we provide all the so-far available documentation of the device itself.

1. [Hardware](hardware)
2. Software
3. User Interface

There are also special topics like:
* [Use the build system](dev_build_system)
* [Create your own effect](dev_create_effect)
