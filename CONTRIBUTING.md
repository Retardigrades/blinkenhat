We try to review and merge all contributions as soon as possible.
To keep things readable, please format all your code according to the LLVM code style.
The easiest way to achieve this is to use the [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) tool.
Just run it over your code before you commit:
```
$ clang-format -style=LLVM -i <filename>
```
